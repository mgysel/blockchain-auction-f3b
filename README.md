# Sealed-Bid Blockchain Auctions using F3B

## Project Description

This project implements a traditional and F3B sealed-bid blockchain auction on EPFL Decentralized and Distributed Computing Laboratory's Dela using Flash Freezing Flash Boys (F3B).  In sealed-bid auctions, all bidders submit secret bids during the bidding period. When the bidding period is complete, the bids are unsealed and the highest bidder is declared the winner. 

An in-depth discussion of the project can be viewed in `Final Report.pdf` and `Final Presentation.pdf`.

### Traditional Auction Description
In the traditional auction, each bidder submits a bid transaction during the bidding period and a reveal transaction during the reveal period. The bid transaction consists of both a commit and deposit. The bidder’s commit is the SHA256 hash of the bid and a chosen random nonce. The bidder’s deposit is a payment at least as large as the bid itself.The reveal transaction consists of the bid and random nonce. 

During the bidding period, the auction smart contract stores the bidder’s commit and deposit. During the reveal period, the auction smart contract checks that each reveal matches its corresponding bid and stores the matching reveals. When the reveal period is complete, the auction smart contract selects the highest bidder as the winner and refunds the deposit of each losing bidder. 

### F3B Auction Description
In the F3B Auction, each bidder submits an encrypted bid transaction that is stored on the blockchain. This encrypted bid transaction consists only of the bid, which is transferred to the auction smart contract if it is the highest bid. When the bidding period is complete, the secret-management committee releases the decryption keys for each bid transaction, and the bid transactions are decrypted and executed. The auction smart contract then receives the executed bid transactions. The auction smart contract stores the bid of the highest bidder and does not accept bids of lower bidders. Thus, when a higher bid is received, the auction smart contract stores this new highest bid and bidder and refunds the bid from the previous highest bidder.

This framework aims to deliver a modular approach to a public ledger implementation. This project is under heavy development at this stage. Don't consider using it for the moment.
